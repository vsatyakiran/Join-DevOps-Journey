# Day 2: Software Development Life Cycle

<div class="date">August 10, 2024</div>

## What is Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software development teams to design, develop, and test high-quality software. It consists of a series of phases that help guide the development process from initial concept to final product delivery. The SDLC framework ensures that software is developed efficiently, on time, and within budget.

## Phases of SDLC

The typical phases of the Software Development Life Cycle include:

1. **Planning:** In this phase, project goals, requirements, and constraints are defined. A project plan is created, outlining the scope, timeline, and resources needed.

2. **Analysis:** During the analysis phase, the project team gathers and analyzes requirements from stakeholders. This phase focuses on understanding the needs of end-users and defining the software's functionality.

3. **Design:** The design phase involves creating a detailed technical design based on the requirements gathered in the analysis phase. This phase outlines the architecture, data structures, interfaces, and modules of the software.

4. **Implementation:** In the implementation phase, developers write code based on the design specifications. This phase involves coding, unit testing, and integration testing to ensure that the software functions as intended.

5. **Testing:** The testing phase involves verifying that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. Testing includes functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and user acceptance testing.

6. **Deployment:** Once the software has been thoroughly tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment. This phase involves installing the software, configuring it for end-users, and providing training and support.

7. **Maintenance:** The maintenance phase involves ongoing support and updates to the software. This phase ensures that the software remains functional, secure, and up-to-date with changing requirements.

## Where does devops fit in SDLC?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the software development life cycle and deliver high-quality software more quickly. DevOps emphasizes automation, collaboration, and continuous integration and deployment. DevOps practices are integrated throughout the SDLC to **streamline development, testing, deployment, and maintenance processes.**

## Key Concepts in SDLC

- **Waterfall Model:** The Waterfall Model is a linear and sequential approach to software development. It consists of distinct phases that must be completed in order, with each phase building on the previous one.

- **Agile Methodology:** Agile is an iterative and flexible approach to software development. Phases of project are completed in parallel to each other by various teams. Agile methodology is more adaptive to changes and customer feedback.

- **DevOps Integration:** DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the software development life cycle and deliver high-quality software more quickly. DevOps emphasizes automation, collaboration, and continuous integration and deployment.
