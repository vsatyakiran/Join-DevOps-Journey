# Day 4: Linux Commands 

<div class="date">August 12, 2024</div>

Today, I focused on essential Linux commands and their usage. Here's a summary of what I learned:

## What is linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system kernel that is used in a wide variety of systems, from servers to smartphones. It provides a powerful command-line interface for system administration and file management.


## Key Commands

- `nproc`: Display the number of processing units available
- `df -h`: Show disk free space in human-readable format
- `free`: Display amount of free and used memory in the system
- `top`: Show real-time view of running processes
- `man`: Display the manual page for a command
- `touch`: Create a new empty file or update file timestamps
- `history`: Show command history
- `awk`: Pattern scanning and processing language
- `grep`: Search for patterns in files
- `cat`: Concatenate files and print on the standard output
- `vim`: Text editor (insert mode: 'i', quit: ':q!', write and quit: ':wq', escape: 'esc')
- `who`: Show who is logged on
- `chmod`: Change file mode bits (e.g., 777 for full permissions)
- `sh file_name.sh`: Execute a shell script
- `./filename`: Execute any file

## Key Takeaways
