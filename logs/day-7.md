# Day 7: Aws Services for DevOps

<div class="date">August 15, 2024</div>

Today, I explored various AWS services that are commonly used in DevOps practices. Here's a summary of what I learned:

## What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of services to help businesses scale and grow. It provides on-demand computing resources and services, making it easier for organizations to build and deploy applications without the need for physical infrastructure.

## AWS Services for DevOps

### 1. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

- **Description:** Virtual servers in the cloud that can be used to run applications and workloads. It is a scalable and flexible service that allows you to launch instances with different configurations. 
- **Use Cases:** Hosting websites, running applications, and testing environments.

### 2. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- **Description:** Scalable object storage service for storing and retrieving data. It stores data as objects within buckets, making it easy to manage and access data. 
- **Use Cases:** Data backup, archiving, and content distribution.

### 3. AWS Lambda

- **Description:** Serverless computing service that runs code in response to events. It automatically scales and manages the infrastructure needed to run your code. Also used for automating tasks and processing data.
- **Use Cases:** Building serverless applications, automating tasks, and processing data.

### 4. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)

- **Description:** Managed database service for relational databases.
- **Use Cases:** Hosting databases, data warehousing, and analytics.

### 5. Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

- **Description:** Virtual network service that allows you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated section of the cloud. It provides control over your virtual networking environment, including IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.
- **Use Cases:** Network isolation, security, and custom network configurations.

### 6. AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)

- **Description:** Service for managing user access to AWS resources securely. It allows you to create and manage users, groups, and roles to control who can access your AWS resources. 
- **Use Cases:** User authentication, authorization, and permissions management.

### 7. Amazon CloudWatch

- **Description:** Monitoring and observability service for AWS resources and applications. It provides data and insights to monitor performance, set alarms, and troubleshoot issues. Generates logs, metrics, and events. 
- **Use Cases:** Monitoring performance, setting alarms, and troubleshooting issues.

### 8. Amazon EBS

- **Description:** Block storage service for EC2 instances. It provides persistent storage volumes that can be attached to instances. If the instance is terminated, the data remains in the EBS volume.
- **Use Cases:** Storing data, databases, and application files.

### 9. Cloud Build Services

- **Description:** Services that help you build, test, and deploy applications on AWS. It includes services like AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodePipeline.
    -**codebuild:** Fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages.
    -**codedeploy:** Automated deployment service that makes it easy to deploy applications to EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and more.
    -**codepipeline:** Continuous integration and continuous delivery service that automates the build, test, and deployment phases of your release process.
- **Use Cases:** Continuous integration, continuous deployment, and automation of build processes.

### 10. AWS configuration management services

- **Description:** Services that help you manage and configure your AWS resources. It includes services like AWS Config, AWS OpsWorks, and AWS Systems Manager.
    -**config:** Service that provides a detailed inventory of your AWS resources and configuration history.
    -**opsworks:** Service that helps you automate operational tasks like deployment, monitoring, and scaling.
    -**systems manager:** Service that helps you manage your EC2 instances, on-premises servers, and other AWS resources.
- **Use Cases:** Configuration management, automation, and compliance monitoring.

### 11. Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)

- **Description:** Fully managed container orchestration service that allows you to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. It is a scalable service that simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications.
- **Use Cases:** Containerized applications, microservices, and scalable deployments.

### 12. Amazon cloud Trail

- **Description:** Service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. It provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command-line tools, and other AWS services.
- **Use Cases:** Security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance monitoring.

### 13. Billing and Costing

- **Description:** Services that help you monitor and manage your AWS costs. It includes services like AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and AWS Cost and Usage Report. 
    -**cost explorer:** Service that helps you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage.
    -**budgets:** Service that helps you set custom cost and usage budgets and receive alerts when you exceed them.
    -**cost and usage report:** Service that provides a detailed report of your AWS costs and usage.
- **Use Cases:** Cost optimization, budgeting, and cost tracking.

### 14. AWS KMS (Key Management Service)

- **Description:** Service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. It integrates with other AWS services to help you protect your data.
- **Use Cases:** Data encryption, key management, and security.

### 15. AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

- **Description:** Managed Kubernetes service that allows you to run Kubernetes on AWS without the need to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes clusters. it provides a highly available and secure Kubernetes control plane.
- **Use Cases:** Containerized applications, microservices, and scalable deployments.

### 16. AWS ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

- **Description:** Services that help you collect, store, and analyze log data. It includes services like Amazon Elasticsearch Service, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and Amazon Kinesis.
    -**elasticsearch:** Service that makes it easy to deploy, secure, and operate Elasticsearch clusters.
    -**logstash:** Service that helps you collect, parse, and enrich log data for analysis.
    -**kibana:** Service that helps you visualize and analyze log data in real-time.
- **Use Cases:** Log management, monitoring, and troubleshooting.


These are just a few of the many AWS services available for DevOps practices. Each service offers unique features and capabilities that can help streamline development, deployment, and operations processes in the cloud.
